Some info about the scripts in the repo:

-- gravity_opt.py is for optimizing efficiency. It's pretty boring and reads a lot like a matab script. It's just a ton of math statements.

-- gravity_n.py is what I made when I wasn't sure what Abigail wanted, I think it's more interesting code-wise, but doesn't optimize energy efficiency.

-- gravity_5.py is a less-robust version of the above, and should probably just be deleted from the repo, but I kept it for records sake. 

I strongly suggest reading gravGen.pdf if you want to see the math behind the python scripts. It outlines the thought process behind the code.
